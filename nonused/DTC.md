# Constellr DTC
Constellr-DTC provides hourly Land Surface temperature data at 30-meter resolution. 

Please note that this tool is still under development, and further improvements are expected soon.

## Overall Objectives 

The goal is to model the daily fluctuation in Land Surface Temperature (LST) at the highest spatial resolution possible. The primary advantage of this methodology is its ability to fusion multiple LST data sources at different resolutions. In other word, we are using constellr-DTC as a data fusion method between high resolution images (Landsat and Ecostress) and high temporal resolutions images (Mosaic of various geostationary satellites) to output high temporal and spatial resolution images. 

## The input data to constellr-DTC

### High temporal resolution images - geostationary satellites 

The constellr-DTC model will require a time-series of hourly LST measurements from a geostationary satellite over multiple days. That data usually comes from GOES, SEVIRI and HIMAWARI missions. 

### High Spatial resolution images - polar orbital satellites 

The second type of input refers to high spatial resolution data from polar orbital satellites, typically Landsat and Ecostress. Data from the constellr Hive mission will be integrated as soon as it is available.

## Constellr-DTC methodology 

The general steps leading to generate the diurnal temperature cycle modelling data are listed below. 

### 1- Parameter initialization 

Time-Related Parameters: Derived from location and timestamps using solar geometry. Solar sunrise approximates t_sr, solar noon approximates t_max, and sunset + 1 hour approximates t_ss.

Temperature-Related Parameters: Derived from geostationary satellites. Missing values for T_sr and T_max are interpolated at the pixel level for up to four consecutive missing timestamps. If still missing, an interpolation followed by extrapolation based on adjacent day T_sr and T_max is applied.

### 2- Low resolution Fitting 

Least Square Approach: Allows individual residuals minimization with error measures, boundary constraints on T_sr and T_max, and control over the loss function

DTC Interpolation: After fitting, the original low-resolution LST values are replaced by the predicted values from the model to fill missing LST values, preparing for the second fitting.

### 3- High Resolution Fitting 

The second fitting includes both high and low-resolution images, with a subset of parameters finely tuned. High-resolution image errors are weighted by their count. LST spread within each low-resolution pixel is checked to derive an LST error. Nearby timestamps are assumed to have similar error ranges.

## File-naming convention

LST layers are provided and follow this compact naming convention:

YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS_DTC.tif

Where

- YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS is the datatake sensing time of the land surface temperature in isoformat. Time is based on Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

- DTC is the model name
  
- .tif is the geospatial raster format used to store the data
