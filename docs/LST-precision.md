  <summary>What is <b>LST precision</b>?</summary>

  LSTprecision delivers exceptional satellite-based land surface temperature sensitivity and details, enabling accurate absolute temperature measurements. It is designed for precise thermal data, making it ideally suited for urban, vegetation, and industrial analyses with new levels of coverage, detail, and accuracy.  LSTprecision also delivers co-registered accurate surface reflectance measurements across ten visible and near-infrared bands. This enables for example the generation of true-color imagery and the calculation of key vegetation indices providing complementary information for more robust temperature analyses.
