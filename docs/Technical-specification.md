## Capability Statement
This document is intented to always provide you the latest version of our capability statement. Download [here](https://public-data-213979744349.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/capability-statement/Capability+statement+constellr+PUBLIC+v1.3.pdf)

## Footnotes
[^custom-label]: Performances are only warranted for daytime observations of land surfaces (for islands only if larger than 100 km2) between 50°S and 55°N. All numbers are cloud coverage dependent.
  
[^2]: Defined as resampled pixel size of Land Surface Temperature (LST) products. For LSTprecision and LSTzoom native nadir looking Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) at 510km altitude is 27.3 m for Thermal Infrared data, while GSD for LSTfusion varies with different input data sources. GSD defined as a pixel projection on ground. For LSTzoom higher resolution VNIR bands are used for sharpening to 10m.

[^3]: For LSTprecision and LSTzoom frequency relates to the geometric revisit time, defined as the mean number of observation opportunities over a period of 3 months. In 2025 < 4 days is equatorial, < 3 days at ± 40o+ latitudes and < 2 days between ± 60o and ± 80o latitude. For LSTfusion frequency defines the regularity with which data output is delivered.

[^4]: Defined in UTC at equator with ensured observation time consistency of maximum 1h difference between local time of two acquisitions of a same area or adjusted accordingly. Subject to final orbits and constellation geometry. Applicable only to day-time observations.​

[^5]: constellr's first satellite Sky-Bee1 of the HiVE constellation was launched 15.01.2025.  

[^6]: Defined as absolute temperature error. Value defined at Mid-Latitude Summer atmosphere, ground temperature of 295K, ground cover with emissivity 0.98. High atmospheric water vapour may lead to local deviations in temperature accuracy. The Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference (NETD) is defined as the minimum resolvable temperature difference. 

[^7]: Defined as the time between image acquisition by a satellite and delivery of LST data corresponding to the acquisition. 2σ (95%) over 1000 deliveries.​
