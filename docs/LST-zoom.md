# **LSTzoom** 
<br>

??? note "What is LSTzoom?"
      LSTzoom is optimized for localized analysis where fine spatial detail is critical, such as thermal footprints for defence and intelligence and for infrastructure and industrial hotspots. It is based on our [LSTprecision product](https://constellr.github.io/product-lst/Constellr-product-offer/) with an additional sharpening algorithm applied to it to increase the spatial resolution up to 10m.   

 
??? note "When should you use LSTzoom?"
    - *See more, see clearly:* Visually detect even the smallest local variations with high-resolution temperature detail. 
    - *Effortless understanding:* Granular thermal contrasts make interpretation straightforward, turning complex data into clear asset-level insights.  
    - *Intelligence at scale:* Refined contrast brings hidden patterns to light, unlocking smarter monitoring and decision-making.  
    - *Stay ahead of risks:* Identify early warning signs of stress across infrastructure, materials, and the environment before problems escalate.  
    - *Track change over time:* Frequent revisit cycles (as fast as every 3 days in daylight) build a powerful time-series for spotting anomalies and long-term trends with confidence.

??? note "How is LSTzoom created?"
    LSTzoom is generated by training a Machine Learning model, that learns a mapping between high-resolution VNIR data (10 m) and coarser resolution  temperature of the land surface (30 m). The goal is to upscale the spatial resolution of LST data while preserving accuracy, consistency, and capture the geometric features present in the VNIR data. The key steps involved in training the model and creating the final product are:  
    
    - **Downsample** the VNIR data to 30 m to match the resolution of the LST data.  
    - **Select only the most stable, low-noise regions as training samples** to ensure sharper, more reliable image enhancement.  
    - **Train both local (window-wise)** and **global models** across the scene using the Decision Tree Regressor.  
    - **Predict high-resolution LST** at 10 m using the trained models and full-resolution VNIR input.  
    - **Fuse global and local predictions** to generate a robust, high-accuracy estimate.  
    - **Apply residual correction** to ensure consistency with the original 30 m LST data. 

    LSTzoom is thus a Level 3 (L3) product that refers to products resulting from the further processing of L2 data or model output based on L2 data and other external datasets, as shown in the figure below.

??? note "How accurate is LSTzoom?"
    The methodology used to generate the LSTzoom product was evaluated against high-resolution airborne land surface temperature measurements from the [HYTES instrument](https://hytes.jpl.nasa.gov). The LSTzoom algorithm was applied to a downscaled version of these reference data, and the resulting outputs were compared with the original observations. In challenging urban environments, the estimated accuracy of the method is better than 5 K.
