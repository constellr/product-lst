## Unveiling hiddin insights with thermal data

Thermal satellite imagery provides a direct window into Earth’s temperature patterns by detecting the heat emitted from the surface, offering insights invisible to conventional optical sensors by providing land surface temperature (LST). Surface temperature is a fundamental driver of ecosystem processes, infrastructure behavior, and climate-related change. By mapping heat distribution and tracking temperature dynamics, thermal data plays a crucial role in understanding ecosystem functioning, monitoring infrastructure performance, and detecting the impacts of climate variability and change. 

Beyond environmental monitoring, thermal observations support applications in disaster response, border monitoring, vessel monitoring, and situational awareness by revealing thermal anomalies associated with wildfires, energy infrastructure disruptions, or unusual heat signatures in remote areas on land and sea. These capabilities contribute to resilience planning and operational awareness while providing a layer of insight that complements conventional imagery for organizations focused on humanitarian, security, and critical infrastructure protection missions.

Surface temperature measurements play a vital role in advancing progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Adopted in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the SDGs form a global blueprint for peace, prosperity, and environmental stewardship. Temperature monitoring plays a critical role in achieving at least 14 of the 17 goals.

LST reveals processes invisible to optical imager, such as evapotranspiration in crops, surface and urban heat islands, or anomalies in industrial infrastructure. Together, optical and thermal data create a richer, more actionable picture of our planet’s surface dynamics. 

There are many advantages of thermal data, find below a few of the most important ones:  

- **Faster insights:** Temperature is a physical variable, which is a lot closer to insights in many use cases compared to visual data (and will hence need less computational effort to extract the same inisghts). While there are many reasons why leaf colour changes, temperature-derived vegetative stress is a direct quantification of the health of a plant, on which one can act. Road temperatures directly link to road erosion and maintenance requirements, the heat radiation from a building is highly related to its material and insulation.  
- **Early warning capabilities:**  Anomalies in temperatures, be it in ways of detecting vegetative stress, the radiative heat of a power plant, or monitoring pollution in rivers, indicate symptoms of early damage, even before it is visible to the eye. A loss of yield, a power outage, or an algae blooming downriver can be better prepared for with an earlier understanding of risk and providing the capabilities of early warnings. 
- **Predictive:** By using physical and AI models that fill gaps between thermal data points over time and space, we can project these insights into the future. This effectively enables forward-looking analysis to anticipate upcoming thermal conditions, enabling proactive decision-making for operations, maintenance, and network planning.  

Today, thermal Earth observation (EO) data holds immense strategic value, constellr is a key player delivering high quality, spatial resolution, and precision LST. constellr’s LST is  improving global and temporal coverage of   thermal data, to deliver new value across cities, farms, and ecosystems worldwide.   

## LST definition and its importance

The temperature of the Earth's land surface represents how hot the ground would feel if touched at a specific location. Such temperature is measured using thermal and optical sensors, such as those used by constellr’s satellites. From a satellite perspective, the "surface" could be anything visible from space—snow, grass, rooftops, industrial buildings, or forest canopies. Importantly, LST differs from air temperature, which is typically measured by ground-based weather stations at about 2 meters above the surface and reported by weather forecasts. While LST reflects the actual skin temperature of the Earth’s surface, air temperature represents the temperature of the air above it—meaning the two can differ significantly, such as under clear skies and in urban areas.

Through consistently delivering high-quality LST data over time, it becomes possible to make more intelligent data-driven decisions for the environment, economy, and societal resilience. Surface temperature data empowers actionable intelligence for the sustainable management of agricultural, infrastructural, and industrial assets, as well as science. 

**Scientists** monitor Land surface temperature because it affects and is affected by weather and climate patterns. They track how rising greenhouse gas concentrations influence LST and how this in turn impacts glaciers, ice sheets, permafrost, and vegetation.  

For **farmers**, LST is a valuable complement to spectral vegetation indices. While farmers traditionally rely on indices like NDVI to assess plant health and irrigation needs, LST maps offer additional insights—helping detect crop water stress during summer heatwaves and identifying areas at risk of frost damage in winter. 

**City planners** utilize LST data to assess urban heat islands and leverage insights for infrastructure planning.  

**Security and intelligence analysts** leverage thermal data to reveal what is otherwise invisible such as human presence, equipment activity, energy use, and environmental change data on land and sea, from terrain analysis to vessel detection.

**Industrial operators** use LST data to monitor activities at refineries and power plants, enabling better oversight of critical infrastructure, operational safety, and emissions management.

## constellr's acquisition process
<h3>What spaceborne instruments capture</h3>
Constellr’s core technology is based on its spaceborne acquisitions by the High-precision Versatile Ecosphere (HiVE) monitoring constellation of micro satellites, the SkyBees. A SkyBee has onboard sensors that acquire high quality thermal and optical imagery. Thus, each SkyBee is equipped with [cutting-edge sensors](https://constellr.github.io/product-lst/our-technology/) capable of capturing detailed thermal data and data from the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) part of the spectrum.

IMAGE TO BE CREATED/ADDED
<figcaption>Figure 3: </figcaption>

To understand this fully, lets dig a bit deeper into the electromagnetic spectrum, which essentially represents all the different forms “light” can appear in (see Figure 3). Light from a physical understanding is a wave, and depending on the wavelength, it carries more or less energy. Short wavelengths are ultraviolet (UV) waves carry a lot of energy; therefore, they can damage our cells at excessive exposure. They are followed by the “visible light”, i.e. wavelengths that we perceive in different colors. This is followed by the longer infrared wavelengths. The infrared spectrum is very wide and can be divided into the Near Infrared (NIR), Mid Infrared, and Far Infrared. The NIR is an important component of vegetation analysis, as healthy plants reflect a lot of NIR. In comparison, Mid and Far Infrared radiation can give us a sensation of warmth when they reach our skin and are therefore also termed thermal radiation. Furthermore, every object or material with a temperature above absolute zero (0 Kelvin or -273.15°C) will emit some thermal radiation in the form of infrared waves. This can be captured day and night with the appropriate sensors. 

Thus, a SkyBee satellite of the HiVE constellation carries one sensor that detects Far Infrared thermal radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface and another detects visible and NIR (VNIR) reflected radiation from the same surface, simultaneously. With the captured information, constellr provides Land Surface Temperature (LST), a crucial parameter for climate studies, agriculture, urban planning, and environmental monitoring.

<h3>The characteristics of constellr's spaceborne instruments</h3>
A SkyBee satellite of the HiVe constellation carries one sensor that detects Far Infrared thermal radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface and another that detects visible and NIR reflected radiation from the same surface, simultaneously (see Figure 4).

When you snap a photo with a standard phone camera, you can instantly view a clear image. However, this is not the case with a scientifically graded thermal imager, such as HiVE’s. For example, take a look at the raw imagery near Toulouse airport from our HiVE thermal imager(simulated). The airport and the nearby river features are hardly distinguishable until post-processing is applied (see Figure 5).

The VNIR sensor on constellr’s satellites is similar to the [Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/s2-mission), capturing data in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. VNIR data provides crucial contextual information, helping to interpret thermal data accurately by identifying specific features on the ground, such as rivers, vegetation, and urban areas. This is essential for ensuring that temperature measurements are precisely linked to specific locations on Earth.  

On the other hand, Thermal Infrared (TIR) sensors capture the heat emitted by objects on the Earth's surface. This data is critical for detecting temperature variations and identifying hotspots. Constellr captures long-wave thermal data emitted by objects on the Earth’s surface. However, raw thermal images can be challenging to interpret without the contextual information provided by VNIR data.  VNIR data plays a pivotal role in enhancing the usability of thermal images. Without VNIR support, interpreting thermal data can be challenging, as features that appear similar in temperature might look very different in VNIR imagery. This contrast helps analysts pinpoint the exact location and nature of heat anomalies, providing a more accurate understanding of urban heat patterns.  

For example, comparing a standard RGB image with a VNIR-enhanced image near Toulouse airport shows how VNIR data can highlight differences in vegetation, water bodies, and built-up areas. This differentiation is crucial for accurate thermal analysis, ensuring that hotspots are correctly located and identified (see Figure 6).

<h3>LST retrieval process</h3>
Constellr’s thermal instruments detect infrared, they turn it into an electrical signal, which shows how hot the surface is. This signal's strength is proportional to the heat emitted by the surface observed by the satellite (see Figure 7).  

![LST retrieval process](Link)
<figcaption>Figure 7: LST retrieval process</figcaption>

The captured signal follows a journey of a series of steps:  

1. The data reaches constellr’s ground segment then are processed using constellr’s land surface temperature retrieval algorithm.  
2. There are various datasets used to retrieve LST including atmospheric conditions during data acquisition, the land cover type as captured by constellr’s optical sensors, as well as topographical data.  
3. The processed data is further transformed into heatmaps, where each pixel represents a specific temperature. One can visualize temperature distribution across areas by attributing colors to various temperature levels, making it easy to identify patterns like hot spots or cooler zones.  
4. Constellr then makes its data available for customers on through the [End User Platform](Link to end user platform)
