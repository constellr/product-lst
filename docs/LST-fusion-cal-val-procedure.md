# Cal/Val approach for LSTprecision 
<br>
LSTfusion products are regularly assessed using a set of well-established validation methods and protocols, such as the CEOS Best Practices Protocols for Global Surface Albedo and Land Surface Temperature Product Validation, ensuring traceability and consistency across validation efforts.

The comparison of the surface temperatures modelled by LSTfusion with reference ground data in the near neighbourhood of key validation sites demonstrates the high accuracy of the [LSTfusion](https://constellr.github.io/product-lst/LST-fusion). Each data point collected over those reference sites during this early phase of the mission matches nicely the reference measurements. We target an accuracy better than 5K, and under clear-sky conditions, performance is often even better. While certain factors such as persistent cloud cover, snow, or complex topography can affect precision, we have built-in safeguards. Below you can find the comparison of LSTfusion to ground-based measurements in Russel Ranch, an area dominated by agricultural land. A variation from ground-based measurements of about 3.4 degrees is captured, confirming the great assimilation modeling quality of LSTfusion.
