It provides a standardized way to query and retrieve metadata and assets, making it suitable for automated workflows and integration with other tools. It naturally extends a static STAC catalogue to allow for dynamic search based on additional filters. In contrast, a web application is more user-friendly for interactive browsing, visualizing, and manually selecting data products. Use a STAC API for efficient, scalable data access in automated systems, and a web application for a more intuitive, hands-on experience.</p>"},{"location":"API-documentation/#accessing-constellrs-api","title":"Accessing constellr's API","text":"<p>This guide outlines how to authenticate, search, and download your data using the constellr API.

The importance of LST <p>Land surface temperature (LST) measures how hot the Earth's surface feels at a specific location. This temperature is quantified using thermal and optical sensors such as those of constellr. From a satellite\u2019s perspective, the \"surface\" could be anything visible from space\u2014snow, grass, rooftops, or forest canopies. So, LST differs from air temperature measured by local stations, by soil sensors, or reported weather data and forecasts. </p> <p>Scientists monitor LST because it affects and is affected by weather and climate patterns. They track how rising greenhouse gases influence LST and how changes in LST impact glaciers, ice sheets, permafrost, and vegetation. </p> <p>Farmers often rely on spectral vegetation indices to assess irrigation needs and monitor crop water stress. However, they can also use LST maps to evaluate crop water requirements during summer heat and to identify areas at risk of frost damage in winter. </p> <p>City planners utilize LST data to assess urban heat islands and leverage insights for infrastructure planning.  </p> <p></p> Daytime LST monthly composite map, constellr (leveraging a fusion of public data) How does constellr obtain LST from its thermal sensors? <p>Through the \"High-Precision Versatile Ecosphere\" (HiVE) monitoring mission, constellr is developing a unique satellite constellation designed to measure LST. These satellites, equipped with visible and near infrared (VNIR, link to previous article) as well as thermal sensors, will help measure how warm the Earth's surface is. Using special sensors, constellr captures the heat emitted by the surface in very detailed images, showing the thermal data of areas as small as 30 meters wide (30-meter resolution) while VNIR provides information for 10m resolution. </p> <p></p> LST data retrieval process <p>The thermal sensors detect heat (infrared radiation) and turn it into an electrical signal, which shows how hot the surface is. This signal's strength is proportional to the heat emitted by the surface observed by the satellite. The captured signal follows a journey of a series of steps: </p> <ol> <li> <p>The data reaches constellr\u2019s ground segment then are processed using constellr\u2019s land surface temperature retrieval algorithm. </p> </li> <li> <p>There are various datasets used to retrieve LST including atmospheric conditions during data acquisition, the land cover type as captured by constellr\u2019s optical sensors, as well as topographical data. </p> </li> <li> <p>The processed data is further transformed into heatmaps, where each pixel represents a specific temperature.

LST was retrieved and enhanced by constellr\u2019s in-house technology (thermal data acquired by Landsat, courtesy of USGS/NASA) Why do we need 30-meter resolution for our thermal satellite images? <p>From the beginning of constellr\u2019s journey in defining the satellite and sensor specifications, user requirements were collected and analyzed. Understanding the needs of various sectors from the agricultural, natural, and urban environment was essential to design the system according to the needs of those end-users. The requirements emphasized the need of detail in the acquired data as well as a certain level of spatial coverage and revisit time, Accordingly, constellr prepared for the specifications of its instruments, including the spatial resolution of the acquired images. </p> <p>constellr\u2019s VNIR sensors allow us to see a real-color view of our area and provide the possibilities to emphasize vegetation using near-infrared bands. These datasets are of 10m resolution. On the other hand, taking thermal images at very high resolution is challenging because of a phenomenon called diffraction, which affects how light behaves. To take sharper images in thermal wavelengths, the satellite needs a bigger lens. The size of the lens depends on how high the satellite is, and the type of light being used.  </p> <p>constellr\u2019s 30 m resolution propriety data acquired by HiVE satellites provide a great balance of detail, accuracy, revisit, and coverage, thus allowing for valuable data for local and regional scale of thermal intelligence. </p> <p>This is a great leap forward when compared to the resolutions offered by operational public missions imaging in thermal infrared. For example, geostationary SEVIRI, sun-synchronous Landsat, and ECOSTRESS that is orbiting the Earth on the international space station are examples of such great public missions.  </p> <p>Yet, they have resolutions ranging from a few\u202fkilometers to approximately 70\u202fm per pixel, with a tradeoff between resolution and revisit time. Even future public missions will not acquire data reaching constellr\u2019s 30m spatial resolution.

NDVI provides an indication of where there may be issues. Yet, when there is a large amount of vegetation, NDVI tends to saturate. Corn with comparable NDVI values could actually be in very different states.\u202f This would be comparable to someone looking for a new house, by only looking at the price. For the same price, you can rent a small apartment in a city center, or a larger house in the countryside. The price alone is thus a poor proxy for localisation and size.      </p> Figure 3: NDVI time-series of a corn field  in Kansas, USA <p>On the other hand, it is essential to understand the importance of temperature and water at different growth stages (Figure 4). During healthy growth, the corn canopy cools the surface by shading the soil and releasing moisture through transpiration. At critical times, such as crop establishment or pollination, further information, such as field level meteorological or field-sensor data are needed to understand the crop status.\u202f This data can be provided through in-field weather stations and soil sensors, but these are limited by cost and area of coverage. </p> <p></p> Figure 4: The different growth stages of corn and the phases where temperature and water are critical  <p> Considering one field that has a sector that is not well irrigated in the red triangle shown in Figure 5, we can detect this stress using thermal data before you can catch it with a vegetation index such as NDVI. </p> <p></p>  Figure 5: Timeline of a corn field after canopy closure with a segment that is not well irrigated (bounded by the red triangle)  <p></p>  Figure 6: LST maps of the field showing the temperature variation with the segment of the fields that is not well irrigated shown in the red triangle  <p>By using just a few thermal images of constellr\u2019s LST30, acquired during the early vegetation growth stage of corn (from June 11 to June 28), LST can already identify a substantial portion of pixels deemed abnormal throughout the entire vegetation growth period (indicated by the red triangle, Figure 6). On the other hand, NDVI needed additional images (from June 11 to July 22) to flag a significant number of pixels as abnormal. Using machine learning techniques, such as One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), patterns can be identified in an automated manner where anomalies that deviate significantly from the norm within a corn field can be detected.  </p> <p>This implies:</p> <ul> <li>Land Surface Temperature (LST) provides valuable insights into biophysical parameters, moving us from proxies to direct measurements. </li> <li>While NDVI reveals how the crop looks on the surface, it does not explain what is happening beneath or why it looks that way. </li> <li>By combining LST with indices like NDVI, we gain a more holistic view of the crop canopy. </li> </ul> <p>For example, when parts of a field experience water stress, the plant stomata close, causing those areas to warm up, and thus subtle heat signatures that can be observed from space. By analyzing these satellite observations at each stage of a crop\u2019s life cycle, such as corn, we can detect stress early and help farmers take action to maximize their yields.  </p>    With LST30, we can identify these issues early and precisely. In 2025, even more powerful datasets will be available. We look forward to quantifying the major improvements of the outcome with LST fusion to monitor large areas of corm, LST precision to obtain the highest accuracy and sensitivity, as well as LST zoom for the greatest details.  <p>Special thanks to Charlie Siggs, Nicolas Chamberland, Loic Quertenmont, Elsy Ibrahim, Rosa Schmidt, and Yan de Paoli for their valuable contributions to this study and its documentation.
