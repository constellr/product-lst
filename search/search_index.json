It provides a standardized way to query and retrieve metadata and assets, making it suitable for automated workflows and integration with other tools. It naturally extends a static STAC catalogue to allow for dynamic search based on additional filters. In contrast, a web application is more user-friendly for interactive browsing, visualizing, and manually selecting data products. Use a STAC API for efficient, scalable data access in automated systems, and a web application for a more intuitive, hands-on experience.</p>"},{"location":"API-documentation/#accessing-constellrs-api","title":"Accessing constellr's API","text":"<p>This guide outlines how to authenticate, search, and download your data using the constellr API.

From a satellite\u2019s perspective, the \"surface\" could be anything visible from space\u2014snow, grass, rooftops, or forest canopies (See Figure 1). So, LST differs from air temperature measured by local stations, by soil sensors, or reported weather data and forecasts. </p> <p>Scientists monitor Land surface temperature because it affects and is affected by weather and climate patterns. They track how rising greenhouse gases influence LST and how changes in LST impact glaciers, ice sheets, permafrost, and vegetation. Farmers often rely on spectral vegetation indices to assess irrigation needs and monitor crop water stress. However, they can also use LST maps to evaluate crop water requirements during summer heat and to identify areas at risk of frost damage in winter.

A SkyBee has onboard sensors that acquire high quality thermal and optical imagery. Thus, each SkyBee is equipped with cutting-edge sensors capable of capturing detailed thermal data and data from the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) part of the spectrum.</p> <p>IMAGE TO BE CREATED/ADDED</p> Figure 3:  <p>To understand this fully, lets dig a bit deeper into the electromagnetic spectrum, which essentially represents all the different forms \u201clight\u201d can appear in (see Figure 3). Light from a physical understanding is a wave, and depending on the wavelength, it carries more or less energy. Short wavelengths are ultraviolet (UV) waves carry a lot of energy; therefore, they can damage our cells at excessive exposure. They are followed by the \u201cvisible light\u201d, i.e. wavelengths that we perceive in different colors. This is followed by the longer infrared wavelengths. The infrared spectrum is very wide and can be divided into the Near Infrared (NIR), Mid Infrared, and Far Infrared. The NIR is an important component of vegetation analysis, as healthy plants reflect a lot of NIR. In comparison, Mid and Far Infrared radiation can give us a sensation of warmth when they reach our skin and are therefore also termed thermal radiation. Furthermore, every object or material with a temperature above absolute zero (0 Kelvin or -273.15\u00b0C) will emit some thermal radiation in the form of infrared waves. This can be captured day and night with the appropriate sensors. </p> <p>Thus, a SkyBee satellite of the HiVE constellation carries one sensor that detects Far Infrared thermal radiation emitted from the Earth\u2019s surface and another detects visible and NIR (VNIR) reflected radiation from the same surface, simultaneously. With the captured information, constellr provides Land Surface Temperature (LST), a crucial parameter for climate studies, agriculture, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. </p> <p>For more information on our sensors and technology see Our Technology page</p> The characteristics of constellr's spaceborne instruments <p>A SkyBee satellite of the HiVe constellation carries one sensor that detects Far Infrared thermal radiation emitted from the Earth\u2019s surface and another that detects visible and NIR reflected radiation from the same surface, simultaneously (see Figure 4).</p> <p></p> Figure 4:  <p>When you snap a photo with a standard phone camera, you can instantly view a clear image. However, this is not the case with a scientifically graded thermal imager, such as HiVE\u2019s.

This is essential for ensuring that temperature measurements are precisely linked to specific locations on Earth.\u202f </p> <p>On the other hand,\u202fThermal Infrared (TIR)\u202fsensors capture the heat emitted by objects on the Earth's surface. This data is critical for detecting temperature variations and identifying hotspots. Constellr captures long-wave thermal data emitted by objects on the Earth\u2019s surface. However, raw thermal images can be challenging to interpret without the contextual information provided by VNIR data.\u202f VNIR data plays a pivotal role in enhancing the usability of thermal images. Without VNIR support, interpreting thermal data can be challenging, as features that appear similar in temperature might look very different in VNIR imagery. This contrast helps analysts pinpoint the exact location and nature of heat anomalies, providing a more accurate understanding of urban heat patterns.\u202f </p> <p>For example, comparing a standard RGB image with a VNIR-enhanced image near Toulouse airport shows how VNIR data can highlight differences in vegetation, water bodies, and built-up areas.

In such fields, water stress is one of the most common challenges, but it is not always easy for the land manager to spot. A section of the field might start to struggle, but by the time the signs are visible, it might already be too late to fully recover. Fortunately, constellr\u2019s spaceborne technology is changing how farmers can manage their fields. Satellites equipped to measure land surface temperature detect subtle heat changes caused by water stress, often long before it is noticeable from the ground. This story demonstrates the detection of water stress using land surface temperature using constellr\u2019s LST30 product  and a story of satellite data capturing the faint heat signals of stress before the harvest suffers.      </p> <p>In many parts of the United States, corn fields are circular, shaped by the sweeping arms of center-pivot irrigation systems. These systems rotate around a central point, delivering water evenly across the field to support the crop's growth. From above, these circular fields look like giant green disks against the earth\u2019s surface (Figure 2). Satellites capture this unique geometry while also providing detailed information about the field's condition.  </p> Figure 2: Circular corn fields as viewed from the ground and from space  <p></p> <p>     The corn begins as tiny green shoots, gradually growing into tall plants with broad leaves that form a thick, protective canopy. Over time, tassels appear at the top, signaling pollination, and soon after, the corn cobs develop, hidden in their husks until harvest. Using vegetation indices like NDVI (Normalize Difference Vegetation Index) from space, one can follow the field\u2019s greening and growth stages. NDVI provides an indication of where there may be issues. Yet, when there is a large amount of vegetation, NDVI tends to saturate. Corn with comparable NDVI values could actually be in very different states.\u202f This would be comparable to someone looking for a new house, by only looking at the price. For the same price, you can rent a small apartment in a city center, or a larger house in the countryside. The price alone is thus a poor proxy for localisation and size.      </p> Figure 3: NDVI time-series of a corn field  in Kansas, USA <p>On the other hand, it is essential to understand the importance of temperature and water at different growth stages (Figure 4). During healthy growth, the corn canopy cools the surface by shading the soil and releasing moisture through transpiration.

On the other hand, NDVI needed additional images (from June 11 to July 22) to flag a significant number of pixels as abnormal.
