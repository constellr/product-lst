It provides a standardized way to query and retrieve metadata and assets, making it suitable for automated workflows and integration with other tools. It naturally extends a static STAC catalogue to allow for dynamic search based on additional filters. In contrast, a web application is more user-friendly for interactive browsing, visualizing, and manually selecting data products. Use a STAC API for efficient, scalable data access in automated systems, and a web application for a more intuitive, hands-on experience.</p>"},{"location":"API-documentation/#accessing-constellrs-api","title":"Accessing constellr's API","text":"<p>This guide outlines how to authenticate, search, and download your data using the constellr API.

A SkyBee has onboard sensors that acquire high quality thermal and optical imagery. Thus, each SkyBee is equipped with cutting-edge sensors capable of capturing detailed thermal data and data from the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) part of the spectrum.</p> <p>IMAGE TO BE CREATED/ADDED</p> Figure 3:  <p>To understand this fully, lets dig a bit deeper into the electromagnetic spectrum, which essentially represents all the different forms \u201clight\u201d can appear in (see Figure 3). Light from a physical understanding is a wave, and depending on the wavelength, it carries more or less energy. Short wavelengths are ultraviolet (UV) waves carry a lot of energy; therefore, they can damage our cells at excessive exposure. They are followed by the \u201cvisible light\u201d, i.e. wavelengths that we perceive in different colors. This is followed by the longer infrared wavelengths. The infrared spectrum is very wide and can be divided into the Near Infrared (NIR), Mid Infrared, and Far Infrared. The NIR is an important component of vegetation analysis, as healthy plants reflect a lot of NIR. In comparison, Mid and Far Infrared radiation can give us a sensation of warmth when they reach our skin and are therefore also termed thermal radiation. Furthermore, every object or material with a temperature above absolute zero (0 Kelvin or -273.15\u00b0C) will emit some thermal radiation in the form of infrared waves. This can be captured day and night with the appropriate sensors. </p> <p>Thus, a SkyBee satellite of the HiVE constellation carries one sensor that detects Far Infrared thermal radiation emitted from the Earth\u2019s surface and another detects visible and NIR (VNIR) reflected radiation from the same surface, simultaneously. With the captured information, constellr provides Land Surface Temperature (LST), a crucial parameter for climate studies, agriculture, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. </p> <p>For more information on our sensors and technology see Our Technology page</p> The characteristics of constellr's spaceborne instruments <p>A SkyBee satellite of the HiVe constellation carries one sensor that detects Far Infrared thermal radiation emitted from the Earth\u2019s surface and another that detects visible and NIR reflected radiation from the same surface, simultaneously (see Figure 4).</p> <p></p> Figure 4:  <p>When you snap a photo with a standard phone camera, you can instantly view a clear image. However, this is not the case with a scientifically graded thermal imager, such as HiVE\u2019s.

VNIR data provides crucial contextual information, helping to interpret thermal data accurately by identifying specific features on the ground, such as rivers, vegetation, and urban areas. This is essential for ensuring that temperature measurements are precisely linked to specific locations on Earth.\u202f </p> <p>On the other hand,\u202fThermal Infrared (TIR)\u202fsensors capture the heat emitted by objects on the Earth's surface. This data is critical for detecting temperature variations and identifying hotspots. Constellr captures long-wave thermal data emitted by objects on the Earth\u2019s surface. However, raw thermal images can be challenging to interpret without the contextual information provided by VNIR data.\u202f VNIR data plays a pivotal role in enhancing the usability of thermal images. Without VNIR support, interpreting thermal data can be challenging, as features that appear similar in temperature might look very different in VNIR imagery. This contrast helps analysts pinpoint the exact location and nature of heat anomalies, providing a more accurate understanding of urban heat patterns.\u202f </p> <p>For example, comparing a standard RGB image with a VNIR-enhanced image near Toulouse airport shows how VNIR data can highlight differences in vegetation, water bodies, and built-up areas.

Our thermal intelligence helps urban planners and governments to pinpoint temperature hotspots within urban areas, identifying zones with excessive heat. This data supports governments and city planners in developing targeted strategies to reduce heat and improve the liveability of their cities.     </p> <p></p> Heat mitigation measures <p>       Urban vegetation and other heat mitigation measures play a crucial role in reducing heat island effects, improving air quality, and enhancing biodiversity. From trees and parks to green roofs, constellr's thermal intelligence helps urban planners, architects and project developers to track the temperature-reducing effect of mitigation measures on street level, while also enabling monitoring of vegetation health, water usage, and stress levels, enabling better management of urban greenery.     </p> Medellin, Colombia - July 2024"},{"location":"use-cases/#resilient-infrastructure","title":"Resilient InfrastructureMinimize Risks","text":"<p>Critical infrastructure\u2014including transport networks, energy systems, and industrial sites\u2014faces increased risks from thermal stress, material degradation, and extreme weather, leading to higher maintenance costs. Currently, global maintenance expenditures for transport infrastructure alone are substantial; for instance, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that combined operations, maintenance, and infrastructure additions in land transport could cost up to a trillion USD by 2050.\u00a0 constellr's thermal intelligence, powered by high-resolution land surface temperature data, offers a proactive solution by identifying vulnerabilities such as heat-induced material fatigue, pipeline leaks, and overheating equipment. Early detection through thermal monitoring reduces damages, prevents costly failures, and optimizes maintenance by targeting high-risk areas, thereby extending asset lifespans and minimizing unscheduled downtime.

Our thermal intelligence helps monitor surface temperatures across road networks, enabling timely interventions for maintenance and repair. Instead of road-level sensors, which are expensive to implement and only offer coverage of specific areas, constellr\u2019s thermal intelligence can monitor large regions simultaneously, ideal for tracking temperature trends across entire cities or highway networks.\u00a0Whether it's detecting freeze-thaw cycles in winter or identifying heat-induced tarmac damage in summer, municipalities and maintenance companies get the insights needed to reduce road deterioration and ensure safer travel, extending the lifespan of the transport infrastructure and reducing costly emergency repairs.     </p> <p></p> Energy infrastructure <p>       From power grids to coal plants, energy infrastructure is vulnerable to the impact of temperature changes. Land Surface Temperature data provides critical insights for monitoring and maintaining energy infrastructure by enabling the detection of thermal anomalies, assessing environmental impacts, and enhancing operational efficiency. This reduces the risk of outages and harm. For power plants, LST helps monitor cooling performance, detect heat leaks, and optimize energy output, especially under rising ambient temperatures. For pipelines, temperature irregularities can be detected, signaling leaks early and thus improving safety and reliability.     </p> Power Plant, Kuwait - November 2023 <p></p> Greenhouse in the Netherlands - April 2024 Industrial Sites Economic Monitoring <p>     By continuously monitoring thermal emissions from industrial sites, we can detect operational inefficiencies, malfunctions and productivity patterns.

In such fields, water stress is one of the most common challenges, but it is not always easy for the land manager to spot. A section of the field might start to struggle, but by the time the signs are visible, it might already be too late to fully recover. Fortunately, constellr\u2019s spaceborne technology is changing how farmers can manage their fields. Satellites equipped to measure land surface temperature detect subtle heat changes caused by water stress, often long before it is noticeable from the ground. This story demonstrates the detection of water stress using land surface temperature using constellr\u2019s LST30 product  and a story of satellite data capturing the faint heat signals of stress before the harvest suffers.      </p> <p>In many parts of the United States, corn fields are circular, shaped by the sweeping arms of center-pivot irrigation systems. These systems rotate around a central point, delivering water evenly across the field to support the crop's growth. From above, these circular fields look like giant green disks against the earth\u2019s surface (Figure 2). Satellites capture this unique geometry while also providing detailed information about the field's condition.  </p> Figure 2: Circular corn fields as viewed from the ground and from space  <p></p> <p>     The corn begins as tiny green shoots, gradually growing into tall plants with broad leaves that form a thick, protective canopy. Over time, tassels appear at the top, signaling pollination, and soon after, the corn cobs develop, hidden in their husks until harvest. Using vegetation indices like NDVI (Normalize Difference Vegetation Index) from space, one can follow the field\u2019s greening and growth stages. NDVI provides an indication of where there may be issues. Yet, when there is a large amount of vegetation, NDVI tends to saturate. Corn with comparable NDVI values could actually be in very different states.\u202f This would be comparable to someone looking for a new house, by only looking at the price. For the same price, you can rent a small apartment in a city center, or a larger house in the countryside. The price alone is thus a poor proxy for localisation and size.      </p> Figure 3: NDVI time-series of a corn field  in Kansas, USA <p>On the other hand, it is essential to understand the importance of temperature and water at different growth stages (Figure 4). During healthy growth, the corn canopy cools the surface by shading the soil and releasing moisture through transpiration. At critical times, such as crop establishment or pollination, further information, such as field level meteorological or field-sensor data are needed to understand the crop status.\u202f This data can be provided through in-field weather stations and soil sensors, but these are limited by cost and area of coverage. </p> <p></p> Figure 4: The different growth stages of corn and the phases where temperature and water are critical  <p> Considering one field that has a sector that is not well irrigated in the red triangle shown in Figure 5, we can detect this stress using thermal data before you can catch it with a vegetation index such as NDVI. </p> <p></p>  Figure 5: Timeline of a corn field after canopy closure with a segment that is not well irrigated (bounded by the red triangle)  <p></p>  Figure 6: LST maps of the field showing the temperature variation with the segment of the fields that is not well irrigated shown in the red triangle  <p>By using just a few thermal images of constellr\u2019s LST30, acquired during the early vegetation growth stage of corn (from June 11 to June 28), LST can already identify a substantial portion of pixels deemed abnormal throughout the entire vegetation growth period (indicated by the red triangle, Figure 6). On the other hand, NDVI needed additional images (from June 11 to July 22) to flag a significant number of pixels as abnormal. Using machine learning techniques, such as One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), patterns can be identified in an automated manner where anomalies that deviate significantly from the norm within a corn field can be detected.  </p> <p>This implies:</p> <ul> <li>Land Surface Temperature (LST) provides valuable insights into biophysical parameters, moving us from proxies to direct measurements. </li> <li>While NDVI reveals how the crop looks on the surface, it does not explain what is happening beneath or why it looks that way. </li> <li>By combining LST with indices like NDVI, we gain a more holistic view of the crop canopy. </li> </ul> <p>For example, when parts of a field experience water stress, the plant stomata close, causing those areas to warm up, and thus subtle heat signatures that can be observed from space. By analyzing these satellite observations at each stage of a crop\u2019s life cycle, such as corn, we can detect stress early and help farmers take action to maximize their yields.  </p>    With LST30, we can identify these issues early and precisely. In 2025, even more powerful datasets will be available. We look forward to quantifying the major improvements of the outcome with LST fusion to monitor large areas of corm, LST precision to obtain the highest accuracy and sensitivity, as well as LST zoom for the greatest details.  <p>Special thanks to Charlie Siggs, Nicolas Chamberland, Loic Quertenmont, Elsy Ibrahim, Rosa Schmidt, Yan de Paoli, and Lena Rester for their valuable contributions to this study and its documentation.
